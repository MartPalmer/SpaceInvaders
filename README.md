# SpaceInvaders-V3
An updated version of the space invaders game I created

A start to a basic space invaders game developed to learn how to use the pygame library and classes. 

Currently has a player which can be moved using the keyboard and shoot bullets. Enemies will move across and down the screen until 
they reach the bottom of the screen. 

Next to include - Collision detection to destroy the enemy ships and for the enemy ships to shoot back at the player.
